We assess how geographers perceive reproducibility and replicability, and to what extent they implement reproducible research practices and attempt reproduction or replication studies. We attempt to reproduce and replicate geographic studies with important societal impacts and/or intellectual merit contributions to the discipline. We also integrate teaching reproducible research practices and attempting reproduction and replication studies into geography curricula at the undergraduate and graduate levels, developing and testing pedagogy to train the next generation of researchers.

A Framework for Moving Beyond Computational Reproducibility: Lessons from Three Reproductions of Geographical Analyses of COVID-19. *Geographical Analysis*. DOI:[10.1111/gean.12370](http://doi.org/10.1111/gean.12370)
   - Presents the practical framework and associated template for our approach to conducting reproduction and replication studies. Include three example reproductions of spatial analyses of COVID-19, which are linked to completed, open access project repositories.

   - A survey of geographic researchers assessing their understanding of reproducible research and reproducible research practices. Key findings include 1) researchers conflate definitions of reproduction and replication, 2) sub-disciplinary variation in the perceived value of reproduction, and that 3) very few attempt and publish reproduction studies.
