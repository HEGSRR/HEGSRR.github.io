We recently published a paper thinking of some of the different ways researcher and professionals might go about improving the reproducibility, replicability, and extensibility of work in remote sensing.

Kedron, Peter, and Amy E. Frazier. (2022). How to Improve the Reproducibility, Replicability, and Extensibility of Remote Sensing Research. *Remote Sensing*, 14(21), 5471. doi:[10.3390/rs14215471](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14215471) 

Making remote sensing research reproducible and replicable does not need to be a burden. 
We discuss how researchers can overcome barriers to reproducibility and replicability in this field. 
Ultimately, we argue for the development of two research streams in the field: (1) the coordinated execution of organized sequences of forward-looking replications, and (2) the introduction of benchmark datasets that can be used to test the replicability of results and methods.
