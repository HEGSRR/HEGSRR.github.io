Congratulations to Kufre Udoh, a spring 2021 graduate of Middlebury College with a major in Geography! Kufre Udoh started his open source GIS journey in the first edition of [Open Source GIScience](https://gis4dev.github.io/) in Fall 2019, and continued the journey into spatial data science and research through numerous courses, self-study, and research experiences.

Kufre provided indispensable help in learning R and Python, specifically to implement solutions and troubleshoot problems for an R-based reproduction of [Malcomb et al 2014](https://github.com/HEGSRR/RPr-Malcomb-2014) over the summer of 2020 and a Python-based reproduction of [Kang et al 2020](https://github.com/HEGSRR/RPr-Kang-2020) over the winter term of 2021.
He also made numerous [improvements to the QNEAT3 plugin](https://github.com/GIS4DEV/QNEAT3/tree/additions) for network analysis in QGIS and contributed to the success of the Spring 2021 edition of the [Open Source GIScience](https://gis4dev.github.io/) course by testing labs, troubleshooting problems, and providing teaching assistant support for QGIS Model Builder, PostGIS, R, and Python.
