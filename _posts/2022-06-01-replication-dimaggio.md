We have published a replication study in the *Annals of Epidemiology*!

Kedron, Peter, Sarah Bardin, Tyler D. Hoffman, Mehak Sachdeva, Matthew Quick, and Joseph Holler (2022). A Replication of DiMaggio et al. (2020) in Phoenix, AZ. *Annals of Epidemiology*, 74, 8–14. doi:[10.1016/j.annepidem.2022.05.005](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annepidem.2022.05.005)

This paper is notable in its status as one of the first formal replication studies in the geographical sciences.
The study examines a prior study ([DiMaggio et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annepidem.2020.08.012)) using a Bayesian spatial analysis of COVID-19 in New York City by replicating the study in Phoenix, Arizona.
Through the replication study, we discover that in Phoenix, ethnic marginalization of majority Hispanic neighborhoods is more strongly associated with COVID-19 incidence than the racial marginalization of majority Black/African neighborhoods described by DiMaggio and others.
