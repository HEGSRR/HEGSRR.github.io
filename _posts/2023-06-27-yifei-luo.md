Yifei Luo joins our project for a summer 2023 research assistantship as a rising senior at Middlebury College with major in Computer Science. 
Yifei will be working on improving the computational reproducibility of our research compendia by creating reproducible computational environments.
Previously, Yifei has applied his computer science skills to other interdisciplinary research projects across our liberal arts campus, including shiny apps for a catalogue of Dutch Textiles for Professor Carrie Anderson: [map view](https://yl8midd.shinyapps.io/maps/) and [attribute view](https://yl8midd.shinyapps.io/values/) and an analysis of [voter suppression](https://rpubs.com/yluo/turnout).

You can find some of Yifei's work on [GitHub](https://github.com/doabell).
