Zach Hilgendorf is a PhD candidate in geography at Arizona State University.
He developed one of our first teaching modules for a replication study using his expertise in geomorphology to teach the [Rosgen System of river and stream classification](https://github.com/GIS4DEV/RE-rosgen), building off of Kasprak et al's (2016) comparison of four different river classification systems for the Middle Fork John Day Basin of Oregon.
Zach prepared a set of [instructional videos](https://youtu.be/rVs4MSw1e5s) to teach fundamentals of geomorphology, learned how to calculate the majority of metrics used for a Rosgen classification using a LiDAR-based digital elevation model with GRASS and R, and wrote a set of instructions for Middlebury Open Source GIScience students to follow!
