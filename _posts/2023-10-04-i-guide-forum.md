The I-GUIDE project has released a [CFP](https://iguide.illinois.edu/forum-2023/call-for-papers/) for the [2023 Forum at Columbia University](https://iguide.illinois.edu/forum-2023/) with the theme *Harnessing the Geospatial Data Revolution for Sustainability Solutions*.

The topics on "Reproducibility and replicability of data-intensive geospatial analysis" and "Open educational resources" are too tempting for us to stay home for this one!
Therefore, we ([Peter](/tags/#peter-kedron) and [Joseph](/tags/#joseph-holler)) are contributing to the forum's program committee and submitting a paper.
Check back here for further details.
