Sarah Bardin joined our project as a PhD student at the University of Arizona. She worked with Peter Kedron on reproductions of spatial analyses of COVID-19 in a graduate course on spatial statistics, and with the summer group study team replicating spatial Bayesian approaches to studying geographic patterns of COVID-19.

When she is not saving the world through her work at [Mathematica](https://www.mathematica.org/), she is saving our research agenda with her technical expertise in R, Qualtrics, data visualization, and spatial statistics, and her insistence that the PIs do things that actually make sense.
