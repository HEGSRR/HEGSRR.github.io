It is difficult to choose a Jekyll theme! As of June 9th, I am committing to the [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) theme thanks to its dark mode and **seemingly** straightforward workflow for customization. I may was inspired by, and hope to learn from the [North Carolina State University](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/projects/jekyll-academic) folks who customized the [Jekyll Academic](https://github.com/NCSU-Libraries/jekyll-academic) theme based on the same [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) theme.
