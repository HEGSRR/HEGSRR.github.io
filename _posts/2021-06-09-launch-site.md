It is difficult to choose a Jekyll theme! As of June 9th, I am committing to the **Minimal Mistakes** theme thanks to its dark mode, simplicity, customizability, and origins in [Buffalo NY](https://mademistakes.com/). 
Here's the [repository](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) and here's a [web guide](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/).
I returned to this theme after learning that the [North Carolina State University](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/projects/jekyll-academic) folks customized the [Jekyll Academic](https://github.com/NCSU-Libraries/jekyll-academic) theme based on the same [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) theme.
