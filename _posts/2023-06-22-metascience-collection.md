Our umbrella OSF Project, [Reproducibility, Replicability, and Open Science Practices in the Geographical Sciences](https://osf.io/c5a2r/), has been accepted for the OSF [Metascience Research Collection](https://osf.io/collections/metascience/discover)!

The [Metascience OSF Community](https://www.cos.io/communities/metascience) provides three platforms for open science about science: a [Registry](https://osf.io/registries/metascience/discover) of completed studies, the [MetaArXiv](https://osf.io/preprints/metaarxiv) preprints, and the [Metascience Research Collection](https://osf.io/collections/metascience/discover) of OSF projects.
The community defines metascience as an "emerging field of research on the scientific process", including research on the reproducibility and replicability of published studies.

We have already contributed one [preprint](/publication/covid-rprs) to MetaArXiv.
Now, our umbrella OSF project is part of the Research Collection as well.
