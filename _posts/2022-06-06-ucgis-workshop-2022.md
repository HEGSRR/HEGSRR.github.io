We presented a workshop on our first year of our efforts developing a curriculum in reproducibility and replicability at the [UCGIS 2022 Symposium at Syracuse University](https://www.ucgis.org/symposium-2022-main), titled *Practicing and Teaching Reproducibility and Replicability in the Human-Environment and Geographical Sciences*.
[Emily Zhou](/people/emily-zhou) was a great help in preparing the workshop materials, all of which are available in the [Workshop-UCGIS-2022](https://github.com/HEGSRR/Workshop-UCGIS-2022) repository.
