We presented a paper at [FOSS4G 2022](https://2022.foss4g.org/) in Florence and published it in the International Archives of the ISPRS!

Holler, Joseph and Peter Kedron (2022). Mainstreaming metadata into research workflows to advance reproducibility and open geographic information science. *The International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences*, XLVIII-4/W(August), 201â€“208. doi:[10.5194/isprs-archives-XLVIII-4-W1-2022-201-2022](https://doi.org/10.5194/isprs-archives-XLVIII-4-W1-2022-201-2022)

We surveyed the landscape of [open source geospatial software](https://www.osgeo.org/projects/) for editing metadata for geographic data in hopes of finding tools to facilitate documenting data in a geographic research compendium according to [international standards](https://www.iso.org/standard/53798.html).
We imagined using such software to thoroughly integrate metadata into the open science research life cycle from the very beginning to support research planning, increase transparency in the research process, and facilitate archival up to the standards of the [FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) for scientific data stewardship.
We did not find an ideal software solution, so we wrote this paper to articulate our vision for ideal software features in the future.
