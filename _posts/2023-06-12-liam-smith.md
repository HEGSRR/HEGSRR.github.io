Liam Smith joins our project for a summer 2023 research assistantship as a rising senior at Middlebury College with double majors in Geography and Mathematics.
To begin the summer, he completed a new reproduction study of Spielman et al.'s (2020) "Evaluating social vulnerability indicators: Criteria and their application to the Social Vulnerability Index" in *Natural Hazards* (DOI:[10.1007/s11069-019-03820-z](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11069-019-03820-z])) and drafted a preregistration analysis plan to extend Spielman et al.'s analysis across time.
You can find Liam's work in our [OSF Project](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/DZPE9) and registered [reproduction study report](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/4S62B).
Notably, this is the first study we have completed using the new [HEGSRR-Template](https://github.com/HEGSRR/HEGSRR-Template) for reproducible research in geography.

I look forward to working with Liam in Fall 2023 to support the [Open GIScience](https://opengisci.github.io) course, especially as they learn from his reproduction study and attempt our drafted analysis plan!

Liam's prior work for GEOG 0323 is at [liam-w-smith.github.io](https://liam-w-smith.github.io/), where you'll find his project reproducing a geographically weighted regression of pediatric hospital admissions for dental extractions in England.
