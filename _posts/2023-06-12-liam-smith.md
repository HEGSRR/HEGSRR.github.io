Liam Smith joins our project for a summer 2023 research assistantship as a rising senior at Middlebury College with double majors in Geography and Mathematics.
To begin the summer, he will tackle a new reproduction study of Spielman et al.'s (2020) "Evaluating social vulnerability indicators: Criteria and their application to the Social Vulnerability Index" in *Natural Hazards* (DOI:[10.1007/s11069-019-03820-z](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11069-019-03820-z]))

Liam's prior work for GEOG 0323 is at [liam-w-smith.github.io](https://liam-w-smith.github.io/), where you'll find his project reproducing a geographically weighted regression of pediatric hospital admissions for dental extractions in England.
