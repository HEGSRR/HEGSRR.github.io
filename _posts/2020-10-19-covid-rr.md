On October 19, 2020, we had the honor of presenting a technical workshop for the [Geospatial Software Institute (GSI)](https://gsi.cigi.illinois.edu/) geospatial fellows program, focusing on geospatial COVID-19 research. The primary objective of the presentation was to introduce the [geospatial fellows](https://gsi.cigi.illinois.edu/geospatial-fellows-members/) to *reproducibility* and *replicability* and their importance in the context of COVID-19.

Our workshop shared its title and purpose with our proposed fellowship project, *Working with Students to Reproduce COVID-19 Research to Establish the Credibility of Findings and Accelerate Policymaker Adoption*.

### Highlights

- COVID-19 is new and rapidly evolving phenomena
- There is urgent need for research to inform public policy
- Reproducibility and replicability provide a self-correcting mechanism in the process of scientific knowledge production
- We can establish the *credibility* of claims in scientific research through reproduction and replication studies
- *Credibility* can be used to *weight* the value of scientific studies for policymaking
- In our project, we will conduct reproductions of geospatial COVID-19 studies with undergraduate and graduate students over the 2020-21 academic year
