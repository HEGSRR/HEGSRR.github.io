Today (August 23, 2021), we had the honor of presenting the final webinar in the [Geospatial Fellows Webinar Series](https://aag-geospatialfellows-series.secure-platform.com/a/solicitations/16/sessiongallery).
The series was hosted by the American Association of Geographers (AAG) to highlight the COVID-19 geospatial research conducted by fellows of the [Geospatial Software Institute](https://gsi.cigi.illinois.edu/) at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.

Our lecture, [*Working with Students to Reproduce COVID-19 Research to Establish the Credibility of Findings and Accelerate Policymaker Adoption*](https://aag-geospatialfellows-series.secure-platform.com/a/solicitations/16/sessiongallery/250), highlighted the work we conduced as part of a cohort of sixteen [geospatial fellows](https://gsi.cigi.illinois.edu/geospatial-fellows-members/).

### Highlights

- An exemplar case of Reproducibility and Open Science in a CyberGIS Scholarly Community: Kang et al's (2020) [spatial accessibility of COVID-19 healthcare resources study](https://github.com/HEGSRR/RPr-Kang-2020)
- The goal of a reproduction study should be to establish the **credibility** of the study's claims, not just the **computability** of the study's results
- We reproduced six geospatial COVID-19 studies, finding that studies tend to:
  - Lack essential components (data, code, etc.) for computational reproduction
  - Lack attention to metadata for secondary data and research products
  - Need deeper interdisciplinary expertise, especially in knowledge domains of geographic analysis and epidemiology
  - Need better justification and attention to uncertainty in spatial decisions, especially with classic problems of modifiable areal units and edge effects
  - Exhibit problems of selective inference, where a few hypotheses with significant results were highlighted from a large number of exploratory analyses
- We developed a [template for reproducible research in the human-environment and geographical sciences](https://github.com/HEGSRR/HEGSRR-Template)
