We were delighted to read the National Science Foundation's new dear colleague letter [NSF 23-018](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2023/nsf23018/nsf23018.jsp) today! The letter cites the 2019 NASEM *Reproducibility and Replicability in Science* consensus study report (DOI:[10.17226/25303](https://doi.org/10.17226/25303)) and highlights "commitment to advancing reproducibility and replicability in science" through proposals addressing the science of R&R, research infrastructure, or educational efforts.
